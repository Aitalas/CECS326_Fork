<h1>CECS326_Fork</h1>

This program asks for user string input and spawns a child process to search a text document for that input.
Upon a successful search, the child process will output the number of times the string occurred in the document.
Else if the search failed, the child will enter into a deliberate bug: it will continue to search for the missing word, printing '.' in the console until it is terminated.
